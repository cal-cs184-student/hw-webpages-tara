		<h2>Overview</h2>
		In this homework, I worked with bezier curves, surfaces, and various techniques to alter meshes (splitting, flipping, and upsampling) in order to become more familiar with the half-edge data structure. Overall, it has becomes extremely clear to me why the half-edge data structure is important for all of these mesh techniques and also how curvature in surfaces is calculated (an extension of bezier curves and de Casteljau's algorithm).

		<h2>Section I: Bezier Curves and Surfaces</h2>

		<h3>Part 1: Bezier curves with 1D de Casteljau subdivision</h3>
		The de Casteljau algorithm is a recursive strategy for evaluating Bezier curves using linear interpolation. When given n control points p and a parameter t (\(0 =< t =< 1\)), you can compute the n-1 intermediate control points p' at a length t subdivision as follows:

		\[p'_i = lerp(p_i, p_{i+1}, t) = (1-t)p_i + (t)p_{i+1}\]

		We repeat this computation recursively by iteratively applying this equation to the newly computed intermediate control points until only one point remains which is a point on the Bezier curve.

		To implement the evaluateStep function, we take a vectors of control points and interatively compute the linear interpolation using parameter t, and push back the resulting intermediate control point to a new vector of points that we return after all of the intermediate points have been computed. The evaluateStep function only computes one level of the recursive linear interpolation.

		<p>Here are my Bezier curves below. The first seven images shows the evaulation progression from the original control points down to the final evaluated point. The seventh image specifically shows the completed Bezier curve. The eighth image shows a slightly different Bezier curve that was created by moving the original control points around and modifying the parameter t.</p>

		<h3>Part 2: Bezier surfaces with separable 1D de Casteljau</h3>
		To extend de Casteljau's algorithm to Bezier surfaces, we can first interpolate along rows, and then along columns. We can treat each row of the n by n grid of input control points as a Bezier curve using parameter u. Then we apply the de Casteljau's algorithm to compute the intermediate points. Then we take those resulting intermediate points and define a new Bezier curve using parameter v, once again applying de Casteljau's algorithm again to compute the final point on the surface. This ultimately allows us to compute the Bezier surface point at (u,v).

		To implement this with code, the evaluateStep method stays basically the same (just using a 3D vector instead of 2D vector on input control points). Then we have another function called evaluate1D that recursively calls evaluateStep until a single point on the 1D Bezier curve remains. Finally, the evaluate function first calls evaluate1D on each row of the 2D grid using parameter u and then we call evaluate1D again on the resulting point with parameter v to compute the final point that rests on the Bezier surface.

		<h2>Section II: Triangle Meshes and Half-Edge Data Structure</h2>

		<h3>Part 3: Area-weighted vertex normals</h3>
		We can implement the area-weighted vertex normal by iterating over all faces incident to the vertex using the half-edge data structure. We loop through all of the neighboring half edges and then get the three vertices of the current half-edge's face. Then we compute two edge vectors and find the face normal by taking the cross product of the two edge vectors. After that, we can compute the area of the triangle (half magnitude of cross product) and then add the area-weighted normal to the sum which ensures that larger faces contribute more to the final normal, thus leading to smoother Phong shading. At the end, it's important to normalize the final sum to ensure that the normal is unit-length.

		<p>Here is the teapot with both shading types:</p>

		<h3>Part 4: Edge flip</h3>
		My debug process was pretty eventful. I don't think it was conceptually that challenging, but more so making sure everything was being reassigned correctly. My first several attempts either caused the desired edge to be completely deleted or would cause my file to load indefinitely. I knew this meant that I wasn't reassigning things properly in order to flip the edge. I decided that the best way to flip the edge correctly is to label all of my edges, half edges, vertices, and faces according to the diagram in part 4. 

		<figure>
			<img src="part4/part4-edgeflip.jpg" width="400px"/>
			<figcaption>Edge Flip Diagram</figcaption>
		</figure>

		<p>Here is my implementation. First, I checked if the given edge parameter is a boudary edge using the isBoundary functionâ€”immediately returning the provided edge if so, as you should never flip a boundary edge. Assuming now that the given edge isn't a boundary edge, I assigned a variable to all 10 half edges in the diagram (the 6 interior halfedges and the 4 exterior halfedges). Then I assigned the four vertices, the five edges, and two faces.</p>

		Now I needed to reassign everything (making sure that everything is still counterclockwise). I reassigned the new halfedges associated with each vertex, each edge, and both faces according to the diagram. Then I used the setNeighbors() function to assign the new next halfedge, twin halfedge, vertex, edge, and face of all 10 half edges. My best debugging strategy was to be extremely methodical when checking my code and also commenting the name changes of the relevant edge, faces, and half edges since my variables directly coincide with the diagram. Finally I returned the new edge.

		<p>Here is the teapot before and after some edge flips:</p>

		</div>

		<h3>Part 5: Edge split</h3>
		Regarding my debugging journey, I found writing the edge split function to be more difficult. I had a good grasp of the problem (from part 4) but I was initially struggling with how to add the new vertex, two new faces, three new edges, and six new halfedges. Once again, I named all of the variables according to the edge split diagram.

		<figure>
			<img src="part5/part5-split.jpg" width="400px"/>
			<figcaption>Edge Split Diagram</figcaption>
		</figure>

		Eventually, I realized after many attempts that the best way to not confuse myself over all the variable name swaps was to assign my halfedges, faces, and e0 replacing M with B. However, I assigned the vertices, halfedge twins, and edges normally with B. Therefore, here are the new elements in my implementation: my new vertex [M], my three new edges [MA, MB, MD], two new faces [BMA, MBD], and six new halfedges [B->M, M->A, A->B, M->B, B->D, D->M]. In other words, I am creating the middle vertex M and the bottom two triangles completely. I set the position of the middle vertex M by using the position field from the Vertex class to be the midpoint between vertex B and vertex C. After reassigning everything according to the edge split diagram, which was much easier after realizing that B/M assignment trick, I returned the newly inserted vertex M.

		My implementation does not support boundary edges. I check if the edge is a boundary at the beginning and return a VertexIter immediately if it is and continue with the function if not.

		<p>Here is the teapot before and after some edge splits and flips. Notice in the bottom right image that the edge splits aren't really noticeable without the wireframe since splitting edges alone doesn't affect shading (you'd need to also move the vertices, etc). </p>

		<h3>Part 6: Loop subdivision for mesh upsampling</h3>
		Loop subdivision ended up being easier to implement than I first thoughtâ€”or at least my errors were fairly small but made the entire thing not work and caused a lot of unnecessary overthinking and debugging. My first problem stemmed from using integers instead of floats for steps 1 and 2 (updating vertex positions). This caused the mesh to only return a few edges and no faces. My second problem was not realizing exactly which edges are new or not. At first I assumed that when you splitEdge on an edge, that edge becomes new, but that is not the case. I debugged this process by having my loops in part 6 break early so I can identify exactly what is happening. Referencing the diagram from part 5, MB and MC are not new! BUT... MA and MD are. This nuance is what allowed me to get the correct implementation.

		So here is my completely correct implementation. First, I needed to compute the position of the newly added vertices in the subdivision. While looping through all the edges, when given a center edge AB on diamond ACBD, the formula to find this position is:

		\[3/8 * (A+B) + 1/8 * (C+D)\]

		Super important! These numbers need to be floats or doubles in the implementation as the position isn't necessarily going to be an integer (obviously).

		Then, I had to compute the updated positions of the old vertices and their associated edges. For this, I looped through all of the vertices and used this formula:

		\[(1-n*u)*original_position + u * original_neighbor_position_sum\]

		In this formula, n is the degree of the vertices (number of adjacent vertices) and u is the relative positions from the new vertex (3/16 if the degree is 3 and 3/8n otherwise).

		The next step is to split every edge in the mesh by looping though all of the edges in the mesh and calling the splitEdge function on each edge as long as its two vertices are both old. splitEdge returns the new vertex that I update to be new with the isNew tag. This is also why it is important to update isNew in the splitEdge function form part5 to distinguish that MA and MD are new but not MB or MC as referenced earlier.

		Next, we need to flip any NEW edges that connects and OLD and NEW vertex. This was pretty simple; once again, I looped through all the edges to find where all three conditions where met and only flipped those particular edges. And then lastly, I copied the new vertex positions into the final Vertex::position.

		<p>Notice below how loop subdivision smooths out sharp corners by adding more edges that are also a lot shorter. This allows for less abrupt changes in vertex positions (as there are more vertices).</p>

		<p>I do think it's pretty cool how pre-splitting edges can affect the shape of what was a cube. To create this distorted cube, I pre-split edges on one corner so that these long edges essentially wrap around the corner and sculpts it in a way to be lopsided. Below are the before (head on) and after (side view) of the pre-splitting effects.</p>

				  <figcaption>Upsampled Results (side view)</figcaption>
				</td>
			  </tr>
			</table>
		</div>

		<p>The other thing I noticed is that as is (no pre-splitting), the cube is somewhat assymetric. This makes sense as the cube.dae file comes with a diagonal along each side that causes the assymetry. To fix this, I just split all 6 diagonal edges so that the cube and all of its edges are completely summetric before upsampling. Notice now that the sube is prefectly symmetrical now after this specific pre-splitting.</p>
