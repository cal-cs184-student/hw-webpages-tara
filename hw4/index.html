		<h2>Overview</h2>
		Overall, this was my favorite homework becaused it answered many of the questions I've always had about collision and lighting simulations. I got to learn about the mass and spring functions important for cloth draping simulations, and how vary constraints like spring constant/density/damping can impact the realism of the simulation. I also got to learn the algorithms behind how to simulation collisions between planes and 3D objects. But not just collisions between objects, but also self-collisions that are important for folding and realism of the simulation. And lastly, I got to build on all of my knowledge from the previous homeworks to build various shaders for my cloth collision simulation, including my own custom shader!

		<h2>Part 1: Masses and springs</h2>
		There are three types of spring constraints: (1) sturctural constraints that exist between a point mass and the point mass to its left as well as the point mass above it, (2) shearing constraints that exist between a point mass and the point mass to its diagonal upper left as well as the point mass to its diagonal upper right, and (3) bending constraints that exist between a point mass and the point mass two away to its left as well as the point mass two above it.

		<p>Here are examples of a cloth wireframe that clearly shows the structural differences between the three spring constraints:</p>

		<h2>Part 2: Simulation via numerical integration</h2>
		During the cloth drapping simulation, there are three important parameters to consider: spring constant \(ks\), point density, and spring damping. 

		<p>The spring constant controls the stiffness or stretchiness of the springs in the wiremesh. A higher constant increases spring stiffness while a lower constant increases spring stretchiness. Below are screenshots of the cloth mid-simulation. Notice how the ripping in the cloth changes. When there is a lower constant (50 N/m), the springs are stretchier which results in more ripplies in the cloth, whereas when there is a higher constant (100k N/m), the springs are stiffier which results in much less rippling.</p>
		<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
			<table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">
			  <tr>
				<td style="text-align: center;">
				  <img src="part2/midsim-ks50.png" width="400px"/>
				  <figcaption>Low ks (50 N/m)</figcaption>
				</td>

				  <figcaption>High ks (100k N/m)</figcaption>
				</td>
			  </tr>
			</table>
		</div>

		<p>The mesh density parameter controls the "heaviness" of the point masses in the wiremesh. Something I find super interesting is that the density seems to be inversely similar to the spring constant. Just like with a lower spring constant, a higher density also increases ripplies and cloth movement. But on the other hand, just like with a higher spring constant, a lower density also decreases ripplies and cloth movement. Because these density changes are so inversely similar to the spring constant changes, I've decided to demonstrate the difference in density from a different angle. As you can also see, higher density causes the cloth to sag more than lower density. Below are images of the cloth in its final resting state:</p>
		<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
			<table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">
			  <tr>
				<td style="text-align: center;">
				  <img src="part2/finalsim-1density.png" width="400px"/>
				  <figcaption>Low density (1 g/cm^2)</figcaption>
				</td>
				<td style="text-align: center;">
				  <img src="part2/finalsim-15density.png" width="400px"/>
				  <figcaption>Default density (15 g/cm^2)</figcaption>
				</td>
				<td style="text-align: center;">
				  <img src="part2/finalsim-999density.png" width="400px"/>
				  <figcaption>High density (999 g/cm^2)</figcaption>
				</td>
			  </tr>
			</table>
		</div>

		<p>And finally, the spring damping parameter controls how long the springs in the wiremesh will continue to oscillate and ripple until eventually coming to rest (assuming damping > 0%). The images below are taken after the center of the cloth drops for the first time (which will allow us to observing the rippling immediately afterwards). Notice how damping removes the rippling of the cloth after it drops initially. The 40% damping doesn't have any rippling in the cloth. Observe below:</p>

			<table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">

		<h2>Part 3: Handling collisions with other objects</h2>
		To handle collisions where planes and spheres, we ultimately need to determine whether or not any point mass is inside the other primitive. If this overlap occurs, we need to adjust the point mass' position to stay outside the other primitive so that they don't collide. For collision with a plane for example, we calculate the distance to the plane at the current and previous positions, calculate the collision point on the plane using the direction vector, and then resolve the collision using the correction vector and SURFACE_OFFSET to prevent the two objects from colliding. For  collisions with a sphere, we are doing very similar things but we are check for a collision by comparing the distance from the sphere to the sphere's radius.

		<p>Below are images of the cloth after colliding with a sphere under different spring constants and the cloth colliding with a plane. As the spring constant increases, the cloth becomes more and more stiff as it rests on the sphere making it harder for it to actually wrap over it.</p>
		<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
			<table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">

			  </tr>

		</div>

		<h2>Part 4: Handling self-collisions</h2>
		I first thought that handling self-collisions would work very similarly to handingly collisions between two objects, but the implementations are actually somewhat different. First we need a hash_position function that takes the position of a point mass and maps it to a unique identifier that corresponds to a 3D box in space in order to compute spatial hashing (groups nearby masses to make checking for potential collisions easier). Then we use the hash_position function in our build_spatial_map function that loops through all the point masses in the cloth and maps each point to a specific 3D box in space. Now we can quickly find self-collision candidates without needing to check all pairs of point masses. And lastly, we use self_collide to actually detect and resolve self-collisions. If two points are 2 * thickness distance apart, we can compute the correction vector to force the two point masses to be 2 * thickness apart and then averaged overall the point masses the vector interacts with. We use simulation_steps to scale down the vector to avoid sudden, unnatural corrections.

		<p>Here are three images documenting how the cloth falls and folds on itself, starting with an early, initial self-collision, and ending with the cloth at a more restful state:</p>
		<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
			<table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">
			  <tr>
				<td style="text-align: center;">

				  <img src="part4/selfcollision-pt3.png" width="400px"/>
				  <figcaption>Cloth in Restful State</figcaption>
				</td>
			  </tr>
			</table>
		</div>

		<p>As exampled before, density and spring constant ks are inversely similar (higher density looks like lower ks and lower density looks like higher ks). This phenonemon is also true here. We can see below that compared to the default images, lower density and higher ks caused the folds of the cloth to be bigger and stiffer, whereas higher density and lower ks would cause the folds to be less stable and actually causing the cloth to phase through the plane if too extreme.</p>

		<h2>Part 5: Shaders</h2>
		A shader program is a set of small programs (written in the GLSL shading language) that are used to calculate the visual appearance of a 3D model based on its lighting, material, and texture. More specifically, vertex shaders are responsible for processing the vertex data (positions and normals) and transforming it into a different coordinate system (e.g. model to camera space). On the other hand, the fragement shader is responsible for determining the color of each pixel that will be rendered on the screen, based on inputs from the vertex shader and any textures that need to be applied. Ultimately the two are able to work together seamlessly by letting the vertex shaders process the geometry and shading, and then passing that information to the fragment shader that calculates the final pixel colors.

		<p>Below are images of my Blinn-Phong shader with only the ambient component, only the diffuse component, only the specular component, and all three combined. The Blinn-Phong shading model incorporates ambient lighting, diffuse lighting, and specular lighting in order to give objects a glossy appearance. The ambient term simulates the constant light that is scattered around the scene. The diffuse term represents the light that directly hits a surface and accounts for how light reflects off rough surfaces. And finally the specular lighting term simulates the shiny, reflective highlights on a surface depending on the view direction.</p>

		<p>Below are images of my bump mapping on the cloth and on the sphere and my displacement mapping on the sphere. I used the texture_4 that was provided. These two approaches looks somewhat similar, but have fundamentally very different strategies. Bump mapping alters the normals using light calculations which gives the appearance of a painting a 3D texture on a 2D surface if that makes sense. On the other hand, displacement mapping actually alters the vertex positions and physically deforms the 3D objects which makes the bumps actually looks 3D. You can best see the difference on the edges of the cloth (bump mapping is still perfectly flat with straight edges where the displacement mapping creates noticebly bumpy cloth edges).</p>

		<p>Below are side by side comparisons of how the two shaders react to the sphere by changing teh sphere mesh's coarseness. I'm not sure if my pictures show this super well, but I noticed that moving the simulation in the GUI that the higher resolution resulted in the bump mapping and displacement being more pronounced. The higher resolution almost makes the mapping look bumpier which is super interesting.</p>

		<p>Below is my custom shader. It incorporates bump mapping, environment-mapped reflections (mirroring), texture mapping, and Blinn-Phong lighting! It looks very busy and messy which shows that adding every shading technique generally isn't neccessary and certainly doesn't help with realism, but I wanted to do something a little crazy. The texture is my dog, the bumps are from the texture 4 that was provided. You can see the mirroring of the bridge in the environment the blends with my dog, and then the lighting (more subtly) you can see is using Blinn-Phong shading (see the specular component most clearly)!</p>
