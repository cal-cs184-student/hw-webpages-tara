		<h2>Overview</h2>
		In homework 1, I built a triangle rasterizer and implement various sampling techniques: pixel sampling, supersampling, and level sampling. I also learned about various coordinates techniques like transformations and barycentric coordinates. Ultiamtely the goal of this assignment was to learn about ways to improve/alter images with texture mappings and antialiasing strategies.

		<h2>Task 1: Drawing Single-Color Triangles</h2>
		Given three coordinates [(x0, y0), (x1, y1), (x2, y2)], I can rasterized the associated triangle in five steps: (1) update the triangle to a consistent winding order, (2) determine the bounding box of the triangle, (3) loop through all of the pixels in the bounding box, (4) identify if a given pixel is inside or outside the triangle, and (5) fill the pixel with the given color parameter if applicable. 

		<p>I determined the winding order of the triangle by taking the cross product of its two consecutive edges which is equivalent to:
			\[ ((x_1 - x_0)(y_2 - y_1) - (x_2 - x_1) • (y_1 - y_0))k \]
		If the component of the z-axis is negative, the winding order is clockwise. If positive, the winding order is positive. For any of my triangles, if the winding order is negative, I swapped (x0, y0) and (x2, y2) so that all of the triangles going forward will have a positive winding order (counterclockwise). Triangles can only be properly rasterized if winded in the same direction, so this step is super important.</p>

		<p>Next, it was quite easy to determine the bounding box of the given triangle, the smallest rectangle that can be drawn around the entire triangle. Out of the three provided coordinates, I needed to determine the (smallest x, smallest y) which becomes one corner of the bounding box, and the (largest x, largest y) which becomes the opposite corner of the bounding box. After that, I can efficiently loop through all of the pixels in the bounding box, starting from one corner to the opposite. Finally, we sample the middle of each pixel, not the corner, to get a single sampling point from each pixel. </p>

		<p>To determine if a given sampling point is inside the bounds of the triangle or not, we can use the point-in-triangle test which requires an equation for each side of the triangle. The derivation for this is simple:
			\[ L(x,y) = V • N = -(x-x_0)(y_1-y_0) + (y-y_0)(x_1-x_0) \]
		where V is the line from point 0 to the given sampling point and N is the normal vector between point 0 and point 1. We can then repeat the spirit of this equation for all three sides of the triangle. If all three lines are greater than or equal to 0, that means the sampling point is inside or on the edge of the triangle. Only if the point is inside or on the edge of the triangle, do we fill the entire pixel with the given color parameter. Once we repeat this process for every pixel in the bounding box, we get a completely rasterized triangle!


		<p>Below are examples of my triangle rasterizations!</p>

		<p>My algorithm is no worse than one that checks each sample within the bounding box of the triangle, because that is exactly what my algorithm does!
		
		<h2>Task 2: Antialiasing by Supersampling</h2>
		Supersampling is extremely useful for smoothing out jagged edges in diagonals in low resolution images, making them more visually appealing at a distance. Supersampling works by subdividing a pixel into multiple quadrants (sample rate of 4, yields 4 subquadrants of that pixel). Then, we can apply the same rasterizing technique as in task 1: we sample the middle of each quadrant and assign a color to it if it is inside the boundaries of the triangle. Now, however, we can average the pixel quadrants' colors so that the pixel will only be assigned one "averaged" color as pixels can only ever present one color at a time. Here is the key difference that supersampling provides. Imagine a red triangle on a white background. It's diagonal originally would have a noticeable jagged staircase due to the high contrast between the red triangle and white background. With supersampling, there might be a few pink pixels along the triangle's diagonal that at a distance makes the diagonal less jagged and much more visually appealing because the pink applies less visual contrast. Ultimately, supersampling results in smoother diagonals.

		<p> To implement supersampling, I made four key modifications to the rasterization pipeline: (1) I updated every usage of sample_buffer.resize() to consider memory usage and the sample_rate when resizing the sample buffer for different sample rates, (2) I updated the rasterize_triangle() method to rasterize the supersampled buffer, (3) I updated fill_pixel() to consider the sample_rate when assigning color to the supersample buffer, and (4) I updated the resolve_to_framebuffer() method to determine the pixels' average colors and downsample the supersample buffer to the downsampled framebuffer that gets presented to the screen. </p>

		For step 1, I've edited the resize function's arguments to be width * height * sample_rate so that sample_rate is considered when resizing the "supersample buffer". To clarify the supersample buffer: the size of the supersample buffer, for a sample rate of 16 (4x4 supersampling) is now 4000x4000 resolution if the framebuffer is 1000x1000 resolution. Lastly, before resize is called, I call clear_buffers() to reduce overall memory usage.

		For step 2, I've simply updated the rasterize_triangle() method to not only iterate through each pixel in the bounding box, but also each subquadrant within each pixel. Then I can continue to rasterize the triangle as normal, passing the subquadrant index into the updated fill_pixel() method.

		For step 3, I've updated the fill_pixel() method to consider the sample_rate and subquadrant index (s) when coloring the supersample buffer: sample_rate * (y * width + x) + s. 

		For step 4, I continue to iterate through the entire framebuffer, but instead of calling the color directly from the sample buffer, I set an inital color to Black (the 0 of color) and iteratively add all of the subquadrant colors of the same pixel together from the supersample buffer. Then I can divide each RGB by the sample rate (number of quadrants per pixel), effectively averaging the quadrants colors, and then reporting that averaged color to the rgb_framebuffer_target as normal in order to downsample back to the normal pixel resolution.

		<p>Look at how increased sample rates make a difference in test 4!</p>

		<h2>Task 3: Transforms</h2>
		Using the translate, scale, and rotate functions, I made cubeman do the classic disco pose. His left arm is pointed to the sky, with his right arm out to the other side. His left leg is lunged out to the side and his right leg is buckled. Looking like John Travolta already!

		<h2>Task 4: Barycentric coordinates</h2>
		In my mind, barycentric coordinates differ from Carteisan coordinates in a similar way to polar coordinates. In a polar system, coordinates are defined relative the the center of a circle: (distance from center, angle with x axis). On the other hand, barycentric coordinates create a coordinate system relative to three points forming a triangle. There are three dimensions in this coordinate system: (distance from vertex A, distance from vertex B, distance from vertex C). These three degrees allow us to create a coordinate space for any triangle, where any negative values refers to the point being outside of the triangle. 

		<p> In my triangle explainer diagram below, you can see how the intermediate colors of the triangle are directly induced by the three RGB vertices of the triangle depending on which vertices they are closest to. This is a great way of visualizing barycentric coordinates. </p>

		<h2>Task 5: "Pixel sampling" for texture mapping</h2>
		Textures are stored as discrete grids of color values called texels. The challenge with "pixel sampling" is that the continuous texture coordinates may not align exactly with the texel grid. For this reason, we require interpolation to approximate a suitable color for the texture space (u,v) given these discrete texture values. 

		<p> For nearest pixel sampling, all you do is sample the nearest discrete texel to the continuous texture point (u,v) that you want. However, this can result in a blocky or pixelated appearance. </p> 

		<p>For bilinear pixel sampling, you perform three linear interpolations across the 4 closest discrete texels to the given texture coordinate (u,v). You first perform two linear interpolations horizontally, blending the left and right sides to get two middle color values. Then you perform a final vertical linear interpolation on those two middle values to get a final color result that is much smoother.</p>

		<p>I implemented the nearest sampling and bilinear sampling functions as described above. After that, I updated my rasterier to use barycentric coordinates that map the texture space (u,v) to the screen space (x,y). I mapped my barycentric screen space coordinates (alpha, beta, and gamma parameters were determined in x,y space) onto a [u0, u1, u2] triangle to get the horizontal u coordinate and a [v0, v1, v2] triangle to get the vertical v coordinate for the texture space (u,v). Then, depending on the desired texture sampling, I can pass in the correct texture color into my fill_pixel() method and successfully rasterize the triangle to have the desired texture.

		<p>Below are some comparisons between nearest sampling and bilinear sampling a different sampling rates:

		</div>
		<p>As you can see, bilinear sampling results in a much smoother texture mapping than nearest sampling. This is most apparent in areas with lots of texture variation. For example, in the image above I chose to highlight the trees as there are a variety of colors that really makes the additional smoothness that bilinear sampling provides much more noticeable. 

		<p>Also, it is interesting to note that bilinear sampling can appear to achieve similar behaviors as supersampling. After all, both resolve high contrast difference between pixels by averaging multiple "samples". Yet there are key differences that are important to acknowledge. Supersampling is useful to give a low resolution image a more "high quality" appearance by smoothing jagged edges, whereas bilinear sampling can stretch or compress textures with a smooth appearance. In other words, given a texture map and a distorted object, bilinear sampling has to choose the smoothest texture mapping. Then, supersampling can reduce any residual heavy color contrast between pixels. In the images above, you can see how supersampling greatly reduce pixel contrast, whereas bilinear sampling chooses initial texture colors that are more symbolic to the original texture mapping (compared to nearest sampling).</p>

		<h2>Task 6: "Level Sampling" with mipmaps for texture mapping</h2>
		We can sample textures at various "levels" which refers to how progressively downscaled the texture is. It is quite useful to sample the appropriate texture level from a mipmap where the texture is being viewed at various sizes, distances, or angles. Level Sampling techniques decide which mipmap level to sample from based on the texture coordinates (u,v) and their scale (texture change).

		<p>I implemented three types of level sampling: zeroth-level, nearest level, and bilinear level sampling. For zeroth-level sampling, I hardcode the level for each pixel's texture to sample from the zeroth mipmap. For nearest level sampling, I round the level (float) to the closest mipmap level integer. For bilinear level sampling, I computed a weighted sum from each of the adjacent mipmap levels. From there, I've updated my rasterizer to calculate the texture change between pixels which is crucial for determine the mipmap level. Larger changes to texture coordinates will impact the mipmap level we need to implement effective aliasing. </p>

		<p>Here are examples of zeroth level sampling and nearest level sampling with nearest pixel sampling and bilinear pixel sampling.

		</div> 
		<p>Now let's compare pixel sampling, level sampling, and supersampling. Pixel sampling is quite fast since it involves minimal conputation and it's memory usage is also quite low since it doesn't require multiple mipmap levels. However, pixel sampling has poorer antialiasing power—espeically when you zoom out and the pixelated parts of the image become more blatant. Level sampling is slower because there is more computation and it requires a lot more memory since you need to store multiple mipmap levels. That said, level sampling is a great way to reduce antialising because it can select the appropriate level of detail required for the scale of the texture. And lastly, supersampling is the slowest because you need to sample & average multiple points and it also requires more memory to store the higher resolution supersampling buffer. That said, supersampling is also a great antialising technique because it immediately smoothes out jagged edges and reduces pixel color contrast.

		<h2>(Optional) Task 7: Extra Credit - Draw Something Creative!</h2>
		For the extra credit art competition, I decided to turn my disco cubeman into a rainbow disco cubeman! Here's how I made it. I used a png from basic test7 on the texmap test5 svg file. I applied bilinear level sampling, bilinear pixel sampling, and 16 pixel supersampling to the swirl. Then I scaled and transformed the swirl to replace cubeman's torso. After that, I changed the colors of cubeman's limbs to match the swirl.
